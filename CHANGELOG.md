# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First release.

### Reading
- Downloads the **World English Bible** (public domain) on first launch and
  reads entirely offline afterwards. Mirrors are tried in order; the British
  edition (WEBBE) is offered as an alternative.
- Keeps the translation's own typesetting, parsed from USFX: prose paragraphs
  that verses flow through, poetry indented by level, psalm titles, section
  headings, stanza breaks, words of Jesus in red, translator additions in
  italics and tappable footnotes.
- Verse numbers set as superscripts, and hanging in the margin on poetry lines
  so a wrapped line returns to its own indent.
- Literata bundled (SIL OFL, subset) so the reading face is the same on every
  platform.
- Full-text search; chapter-to-chapter swiping, with arrow and page keys on
  desktop.

### Navigation
- A Niagara-launcher-style index rail on the trailing edge, text to its left:
  nearby labels swell and slide toward the touch point, the entries under the
  focused label fan out beside it, sliding left hovers one and lifting picks
  it. Lifting on the rail leaves the group open to tap.
- Books A–Z, with numbered books sorted under their name (1 Samuel under S),
  plus a canonical-order mode. Chapters and verses indexed by tens over a
  number grid.

### Bookmarks and resume
- Tap a verse to bookmark, annotate or copy it. Bookmarked verses are tinted
  in the text and flagged in the pickers.
- The book, chapter and the verse nearest the top of the screen are saved as
  you read and restored on the next launch, alongside a recently-read list.

### Theming
- Material You: dynamic colour from the system palette where the platform
  provides one, a seed-colour picker everywhere else, light/dark/system.
- Adjustable text size, line spacing and typeface; red-letter, footnote,
  verse-number and paragraph-layout switches; optional deuterocanonical books.

### Platforms
Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows and the web from one codebase. The web
build re-fetches the text each session (no durable multi-megabyte store) and
relies on the browser's HTTP cache; every other platform caches to disk.
